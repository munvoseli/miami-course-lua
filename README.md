NOTICE:
There is no reason to use this project yet,
since it is very bad,
and the data for Fall 2023 is not yet available.

---

This project is not user-friendly yet,
and at this time requires editing the source.

This project depends on Love2D and lunajson.
lunajson can be installed with the luarocks package manager.

If I ever get this to be user-friendly,
so you don't have to edit the source code,
I will package all of this into an executable.

1. If you're not on Linux,
install luarocks from https://luarocks.org/
2. do `luarocks install lunajson`
(or maybe `luarocks --local install lunajson`)
to install lunajson
3. Install Love2d from https://love2d.org/
(this is used for the GUI)
4. download this project and run it with Love2d
(https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started)
to make sure it works
5. Edit main.lua to suit your classes
6. Change "202310" in main.lua to your desired term code
(202310 is Fall 2022, 202320 is Spring 2023,
202410 will be Fall 2023 once that data becomes available)
7. run it with Love2d again
